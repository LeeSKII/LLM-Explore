    "# Effective Prompting Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "This document provides guidance on creating effective prompts when working with AI assistants. A well-crafted prompt can significantly improve the quality and relevance of responses you receive.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Elements of Effective Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Be Specific and Clear\n",
    "- State your request explicitly\n",
    "- Include relevant context and background information\n",
    "- Specify the format you want for the response\n",
    "- Mention any constraints or requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Provide Context\n",
    "- Explain why you need the information\n",
    "- Share relevant background knowledge\n",
    "- Mention previous attempts if applicable\n",
    "- Describe your level of familiarity with the topic\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure Your Request\n",
    "- Break complex requests into smaller parts\n",
    "- Use numbered lists for multi-part questions\n",
    "- Prioritize information if asking for multiple things\n",
    "- Consider using headers or sections for organization\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specify Output Format\n",
    "- Indicate preferred response length (brief vs. detailed)\n",
    "- Request specific formats (bullet points, paragraphs, tables)\n",
    "- Mention if you need code examples, citations, or other special elements\n",
    "- Specify tone and style if relevant (formal, conversational, technical)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Poor Prompt:\n",
    "\"Tell me about machine learning.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improved Prompt:\n",
    "\"I'm a computer science student working on my first machine learning project. Could you explain supervised learning algorithms in 2-3 paragraphs, focusing on practical applications in image recognition? Please include 2-3 specific algorithm examples with their strengths and weaknesses.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Poor Prompt:\n",
    "\"Write code for a website.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improved Prompt:\n",
    "\"I need to create a simple contact form for a personal portfolio website. Could you write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for a responsive form that collects name, email, and message fields? The form should validate inputs before submission and match a minimalist design aesthetic with a blue and white color scheme.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Iterative Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that working with AI assistants is often an iterative process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with an initial prompt\n",
    "2. Review the response\n",
    "3. Refine your prompt based on what was helpful or missing\n",
    "4. Continue the conversation to explore the topic further\n",
    "\n",
    "## When Prompting for Code\n",
    "\n",
    "When requesting code examples, consider including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Programming language and version\n",
    "- Libraries or frameworks you're using\n",
    "- Error messages if troubleshooting\n",
    "- Sample input/output examples\n",
    "- Performance considerations\n",
    "- Compatibility requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective prompting is a skill that develops with practice. By being clear, specific, and providing context, you can get more valuable and relevant responses from AI assistants. Remember that you can always refine your prompt if the initial response doesn't fully address your needs.\n",
